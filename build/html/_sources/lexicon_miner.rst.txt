Texta Toolkit enables the creation of topic-related :ref:`lexicons`. In order to build lexicons, we must have :ref:`Embedding <embedding_concept>` model :ref:`previously trained <embedding>` .

Let’s create a lexicon that contains verbs accompanied with “bribery”.

After clicking on the newly created lexicon, we have to provide some seed words like 'accuse'.

The process of creating (or expanding) the lexicon is iterative. We keep asking for suggestions and from those we have to pick the ones that make sense to us. We keep asking for suggestions until we get no more meaningful responses. Words we didn't choose appear under the lexicon as negative words. These are considered as the opposite of the meanings we are looking for. We can erase words from the negative words list simply by clicking on it. 

To add a suitable word to the lexicon, we simply have to click on it. If we want to delete something we already chose we can erase the verb from the list.

When we’re ready, we can save the lexicon.
