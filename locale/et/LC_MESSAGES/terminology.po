"Embedding is a statistical model describing the distributional properties"
" of words and phrases, which enables the computation of similarity "
"between words and phrases. In TTK, embeddings are used for finding "
"contextually similar keywords to extend search results and building "
"lexicons. Furthermore, vectors from word embeddings can also be used in "
"neural classification models in Texta Toolkit. TTK currently only "
"supports Word2Vec embeddings, but work is being done to incorporate state"
" of the art embedding models (e.g. BERT from Google Research). "
"Furthermore, TTK will also employ cross-lingual embeddings developed by "
"EMBEDDIA to support multilingual text classification."

"Tagger Group is an extension to TTK’s binary taggers to support "

"successfully tested with over 6000 binary models and prediction times are"
" usually less than 1 second. To achieve this, TTK has employed a hybrid "
"approach for multi-label tagging, which uses unsupervised machine "
"learning (document vectors) to limit the number of binary models used for"
" prediction. In such scenario input document is compared to training data"
" to determine most probable models to produce valid tags."

"Taggers are monolingual binary text classifiers used to predict tags for "

" are trained using a subset of documents defined by a TTK search or a raw"
" Elasticsearch query (big ugly JSON object). The subset of documents "
"defines the “positive” set of examples (the documents about the topic "
"being tagged), whilst “negative” examples will be selected automatically "
"(to be unlike the positive ones). TTK taggers are trained using scikit-"
"learn pipelines and includes models like logistic regression and SVM. TTK"
" automatically splits the training data into training and testing data "
"(by default 80-20) and applies grid search combined with k-fold cross "
"validation to identify best hyperparameters. SVM model is also used for "
"feature selection to remove unimportant features from the model making it"
" smaller. For features, both word-based and character-based n-grams are "
"used."

"Topic Analyzer is a tool that detects groups of similar documents in the "

"However, the main purpose of the tool is to take it one step further and "

"learning models."

"while some clusters may indeed contain similar documents, some other will"
" completely fail in capturing the similarity and most of them will "
"probably be so-and-so."

"Topic Analyzer allows user to look inside each cluster and make the "

msgid ""
"While Taggers and Tagger Groups use classical machine learning to produce"
" binary classification models, Texta Toolkit also incorporates deep "
"neural models for binary and multi-class text classification. As the "
"models are all programmed using PyTorch, the TTK’s component is called "
"Torch Tagger. It allows for the user to use several state-of-art text "
"classification models, including fastText, TextRNN using bi-direction "
"LSTM networks, RCNN using recurrent convolutional neural nets. Since all "
"models have been developed using PyTorch, introducing new models is "
"fairly straightforward. TorchTagger models also include the possibility "
"to use pre-trained word vectors (e.g. Word2Vec trained in TTK) in the "
"embedding layer of the models. To create data processing pipelines, Torch"
" Tagger uses torchtext package. Torch Tagger has been validated on "
"monolingual toxic comment detection, reaching accuracy and F1-score of "
"96%."
