"topic. It doesn't necessarily mean that the clustering process in general"
" has been unsuccessful as often it is impossible to cluster all documents"
" perfectly. However, you still might want to take a closer look to such "
"clusters as there may be other reasons for such results as well. For "
"example, the documents in that cluster may contain similar noise or "
"stopwords that makes them artifically similar to each other. Sometimes "

"Average similarity is an average cosine similarity between all the "

"other. However, the score has some disadvantages. For example, when a "
"cluster contains 9 documents that are very similar to each other and 10th"
" document is very different from all others, then the score might appear "
"low althought fixing that cluster would be very easy."
