"To create a new grouping (or clustering, as we name it) navigate to "
"Models -> Clustering and click \"Create\". Similarly to Tagger Group "
"object, you have to give it a name (*Description*) and select indices and"
" fields based on which the grouping will be done. Additionally one can "
"restrict the set of documents to be used in clustering by specifying the "
"filter with a *Query* parameter."

"If desired, one can do some fine-tuning as well by choosing clustering "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/topic_analyzer.rst:20
msgid ""
"General advice would be to better have too many clusters than too few. "
"Think about how many documents you are planning to cluster and choose the"
" number so that the average cluster is small enough to inspect it "
"manually with ease. For example, if you are going to cluster 1000 "
"documents to 50 clusters then average cluster would contain 20 documents."

#: ../../source/topic_analyzer.rst:22
msgid ""
"Instead of using document-term matrix for clustering, we can also use "
"compressed approximation of this matrix (with parameter *Use LSI*) which "
"is constructed before the clustering process begins. However, LSI also "
"requires the number of topics (dimensions in low-rank matrix) to be "
"specified (*Num topics*)."

"In some cases we may already have some knowledge about the data that we "

"specific stopwords which we would like to ignore. As name already "

"Cluster with significantly larger document count often indicates that the"
" clustering algorithm has failed to separate these documents by the "
"topic. It doesn't necessarily mean that the clustering process in general"
" has been unsuccessful as often it is impossible to cluster all documents"
" perfectly. However, you still might want to take a closer look to such "
"clusters as there may be other reasons for such results as well. For "
"example, the documents in that cluster may contain similar noise or "
"stopwords that makes them artifically similar to each other. Sometimes "
"increasing the number of clusters might help as well."

#: ../../source/topic_analyzer.rst:53
msgid ""
"Average similarity is an average cosine similarity between all the "
"documents in the cluster. It ranges between 0 and 1 and higher score "
"indicates that the documents in that cluster are more similar to each "
"other. However, the score has some disadvantages. For example, when a "
"cluster contains 9 documents that are very similar to each other and 10th"
" document is very different from all others, then the score might appear "
"low althought fixing that cluster would be very easy."
