"One model predicts whether a text is positive (True) or negative (False)."
" That is, whether this text get's the label or not. Tagger trains only "
"one model and predicts whether a text is similar to the query/dataset it "
"was trained on or not. Tagger Group trains several models at once. That "
"means, it can predict several labels at once. Tagger Group trains on "
"facts. We can have several values under a certain fact and for each value"
" (if it has high enough frequency (*Minimum sample size*) a model is "
"trained."

"Our input will be the data under the project that is active (we can check"
" it on the blue panel up-right). We have to select the fields the model "
"learns from. If we choose two, the fields are just concatenated together "
"before the learning process. One field is also enough. Usually lemmatized"
" texts are preferred, especially with morphologically complex languages, "
"because it increases the frequency of some words (*eaten*, *eats* and "
"*ate* will change to it's lemma *eat* and are dealt as one word)."

"Then we need to fine-tune the Tagger Group's classifiers by changing "

"`LinearSVC <https://scikit-"

"might get an error with LinearSVC in case we don't have enough data in "
"the search. We can set negative multiplier to change ratio of negative "
"examples in the training set. We can use maximum sample size per class in"
" case we want to limit the size of data the model trains on."
