"The process of creating (or expanding) the lexicon is iterative. We keep "
"asking for suggestions and from those we have to pick the ones that make "
"sense to us. We keep asking for suggestions until we get no more "
"meaningful responses. Words we didn't choose appear under the lexicon as "
"negative words. These are considered as the opposite of the meanings we "
"are looking for. We can erase words from the negative words list simply "
"by clicking on it."
