#~ ":ref:`Embeddings <embedding_concept>` are basically"
#~ " words converted into numerical data "
#~ "(into vectors) that are more "
#~ "understandable and usable for the "
#~ "machine than plain strings (words). With"
#~ " these vectors created, we can "
#~ "compare words and find similar ones. "
#~ "We need embeddings to create, for "
#~ "example, :ref:`lexicons <lexicons>`. Texta "
#~ "Toolkit uses word2vec embeddings with "
#~ "`collocation detection "
#~ "<https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html>`_. It "
#~ "means that the vectors are created "
#~ "on words and phrases. Phrases are "

#~ "*Query* empty, it will take all "
#~ "data in the active project as a"
#~ " input. We can also use saved "
#~ "searches as our desired input. Then "
#~ "we must choose the fields the "
#~ "embedding learns from. Embedding needs "
#~ "textual data, so we have to choose"
#~ " fields with text or lemmatized text"
#~ " in it. One field is also "
#~ "enough. Usually lemmatized texts are "
#~ "preferred, especially with morphologically "
#~ "complex languages, because it increases "
