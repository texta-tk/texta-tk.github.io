"TEXTA MLP (Multilingual Processor) is an additional module of TEXTA "
"created for the sake of processing and enriching textual data. Capable of"
" processing multiple languages, it's features include the lemmatization "
"of text, Named Entity extraction, entity linking and more. To make access"
" to the module more efficient and smoother, it has been integrated "
"directly into the Toolkit. Choosing which features the user wants to "
"apply on their text is handled by selecting \"Analyzers\"."
