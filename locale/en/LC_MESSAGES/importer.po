"Dataset Importer allows the user to insert **jsonlines**, **csv** and "
"**excel** files into Elasticsearch to make them accessible by the "
"Toolkit. Please note that this process reads the whole file into the "
"memory and can thus create memory issues when trying to process bigger "
"files. It is advisable to split such files up into smaller chunks and "
"process each one separately."

"This whole process is asynchronous so the response to the call will be "
"instantaneous and it since it takes a bit time to load the file into the "
"memory, the first 10 seconds might not display any signs of the progress "

"You can upload a new dataset from a file to Toolkit via Dataset Importer "
"under Tools (see :numref:`importing_loc`). Click on the **CREATE** button"
" which opens a table in :numref:`importing`. There you can describe your "
"dataset (*Task description*), give it a name (*Dataset name*) and choose "
"the file to be uploaded (you can browse it via the folder button). When "
"uploading an .csv file, you can add the separator (usually a comma). Then"
" hit **Create**. You will see the uploading process and metadata of the "
"dataset under the Dataset Importer in the TTK. You can delete the "
"uploaded dataset by clicking on the three dots under actions."
