"Ratio must be a decimal number between 0 and 1 and the number of "

"of sentences you can have is 100. It is recommended to use ratio if the "
"index contains many documents with different lengths and you don't know "
"what would be optimal number of sentences. On the other hand, specify the"
" length in the number of sentences if you need the ouput strictly to be a"
" fixed number of sentences."
