"Navigate to **Tools -> MLP**. Click **Create** button to define a new MLP"
" worker. Select indices and fields on which you want to apply MLP. Since "
"preprocessing the data is quite time-consuming process, it is strongly "
"recommended to select only fields on which applying MLP is actually "
"useful. That is, the fields which you are going to use later to create "
"lexicons or train models on. Lastly, select analyzers which you would "
"like to apply."
